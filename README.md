## 🧪 What I Do (Right Now)

- 🧠 **Curvenote** — I co-founded a startup to fix how science is written, shared, and reused.
- 🛠 **MyST Markdown** — Making Markdown do a PhD’s worth of work.
- 💻 **Thebe** — Put code execution *in* the browser. Yes, really.
- ☁️ Living somewhere between the cloud, scientific publishing and computation.

## 🗺 Where I Came From

- Got into analysing signals, images and computer vision in the late 90s.
- Researched CNNs when all I had was a Pentium.
- Built GPU tools for geophysics when CUDA was the wild west.
- Became a CTO because I can draw pictues too. Still shipping code.
- Got paid to work with researchers and scientists (the really cool ppl).
- Remote since 2013 and still loving it.
- Geek out regularly on geology, molecular machines and genetics.
