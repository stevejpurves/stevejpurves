## 🧪 What I Do (Right Now)

- 🧠 **Curvenote** — I co-founded a startup to fix how science is written, shared, and reused.
- 🛠 **MyST Markdown** — Making Markdown do a PhD’s worth of work.
- 💻 **Thebe** — Put code execution *in* the browser. Yes, really.
- ☁️ Living somewhere between the cloud, scientific publishing and computation.

## 🗺 Where I Came From

- Got into analysing signals, images and computer vision in the late 90s.
- Was researching convolutional neural nets when all we had were pentiums.
- Started working remotely before it was cool.
- Built GPU tools for geophysics when CUDA was the wild west.
- Became a CTO because I can draw pictues too. Still shipping code.
- Been paid to work with researchers and scientists.
- Geeks out regularly on rocks, molecular machines and genetics.
- Somehow all roads lead back to open science and reproducibility.

## 🧠 Current Brain Space

```txt
TypeScript • JavaScript • Web Native • Node • React/Remix • Python • Jupyter • Docker • Graphs • Markdown • Kubernetes • Serverless
```

🧵 Threads I'm pulling on:
- Living documents that talk back
- Rich, semantic, networked content for science
- Lowering the barriers to reproducibility
- Turning publishing monoliths into democratic nodes

## 📢 I’m Into…

- Tools for thought
- Working for the open
- Building things that last longer than their funder’s website
- Running, refactoring, and rethinking
